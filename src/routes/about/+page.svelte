		<h1>About</h1>
	</div>
    <p>PleasantVue was created and is maintained by Amador Valley seniors Ryan Vir and Aayuman Ghangurde. We felt that the student portal experience would be elevated with the addition of more features that would create a super-app for PUSD. Certain features, such as the calendar and staff list, were developed up to one year ago. It was all put together with the StudentVUE integration after PUSD switched its SIS away from Q.<br><br></p>
